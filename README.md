# Project_Popular_Movies
Second Android nanodegree project. This app will show several movie posters, and some extra info when a poster is clicked.
The movies' information is queried from themoviedb.org once a day and stored in a database, and poster images are stored too so the app can run even offline.
Movie details include title, release date, rating, a brief overview and when possible, a list of trailers and another one of reviews.
If thereÂ´s one ore more trailers available, the first one's URL can be shared.
